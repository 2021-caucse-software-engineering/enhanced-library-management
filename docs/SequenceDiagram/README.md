## Why we used draw.io for sequence diagrm instead of hand drawn diagrams?
We could not meet each other on COVID-19 situation, so we thought hand drawn diagram is much slower to collaborate than digitally shared diagrams. (We needed to take a picture of diagram and send through cloud on each changes, but when we used digital diagram we could see what is changed in realtime.)
