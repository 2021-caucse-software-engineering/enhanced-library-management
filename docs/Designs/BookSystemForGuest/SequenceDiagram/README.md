## Why we used draw.io for sequence diagrm instead of hand drawn diagrams?
We are not allowed to have a face-to-face meeting in COVID-19 situation, so we thought we could collaborate faster with digitally shared diagrams than with hand-drawn diagrams. (It is because when we share hand-drawn one, we needed to take a picture of diagram and send it through cloud whenever there is a change. However, we could see the change in realtime when we use digital diagrams.)
